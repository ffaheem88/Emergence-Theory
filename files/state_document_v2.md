# State Document v2

**Session Date**: January 25, 2026
**Status**: Moving from theory to empirical test

## Core Framework (Stable from Multi-Agent Process)

### The FCC Proposition (Testable Claim)

> Emergence is a structural phase transition — Feedback + Constraint + Classification couple to create a causally closed macro-manifold whose macro-history predicts future better than micro-details.

### Testable Predictions

1. **Discontinuous S-Jump**: A critical F/C ratio produces a significant jump in S and TEΔ (p < 0.05)
2. **Manifold Subservience**: At criticality, OFP-ICR ≫ 1 (threshold ≥10)
3. **Generative Self-Repair**: Constructed levels show high MCF (d > 0.5) and PRNP drop < 20% after novelty injections

### Primary Falsifier

If across test systems: (a) no discontinuous S/TEΔ jump is found, OR (b) macro advantage collapses under OFP + novelty → FCC is falsified.

---

## Current Position

### What Happened
1. Original conversation established framework: emergence is perspectival, feedback + constraint + classification generates hierarchy
2. Multi-agent system (Theorist, Critic, Empiricist, Synthesizer) ran 17 rounds
3. Framework evolved from conceptual to operational
4. Applied convergence constraint at v15 → crystallized to v17
5. Now: building minimal empirical test before writing paper

### Where We Are
- Theory is formalized (v17 state document)
- Code specification complete for Boids falsification test
- Ready for implementation

### Next Step
Run Boids simulation to test core prediction: discontinuous TEΔ jump at critical α.

## Key Evolution Through Multi-Agent Process

| Version | State | Key Development |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| v6 | Dispersing | Converging on Hoel-style causal emergence |
| v10 | Still dispersing | 17+ metrics, 13+ systems |
| v15 | Maximum complexity | FCC named but buried in diagnostics |
| v17 | Crystallized | 3 systems, 5 metrics, clear falsifier |

The convergence constraint ("next document must be shorter") worked — demonstrating the framework on itself.

## Files Created

1. `paper_skeleton.md` — Original paper structure
2. `state_document_v1.md` — Initial continuity document
3. `core_concepts.md` — Formal definitions
4. `claude_code_prompt.md` — Multi-agent orchestration prompt
5. `fcc_boids_spec.md` — Detailed code specification
6. `claude_code_build_prompt.md` — Condensed build prompt

## Generative Tensions (Still Active)

1. **The recursion question**: Does level N+1 construction create conditions for N+2? Is this infinite?

2. **Constraint selection**: We have the Boids test, but how do we know alignment_weight is the right constraint to sweep? Could be perception_radius, or a ratio.

3. **Generalizability**: If the Boids test works, does that validate FCC for AI capability emergence? The mapping isn't direct.

4. **Mathematical structure**: The FCC cycle might have formal structure (dynamical systems? category theory?) that we haven't found.

## Decision After Boids Test

| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Discontinuous jump, d > 0.5 | Write paper with empirical support |
| Jump but weak effect | Investigate — maybe wrong metric or wrong constraint |
| No jump | Revise theory — phase transition claim is wrong |

## Reconstruction Protocol

To continue this work:
1. Provide this state document
2. Provide v17 from multi-agent process
3. Provide Boids results (when available)
4. Ask: "Where did we land? What's next?"
