## Timeline

### 2026-02-15 — Project Inception
- Extracted and analyzed Faisal's 2011 FYP dissertation: "Emergence in Cellular Automata" (54 pages, Nottingham, 1st Class Honours)
- FYP demonstrated emergence in 1D/2D cellular automata — complex patterns from simple rules
- Connected this to the broader question: can consciousness emerge from AI agent networks?
- Created `PROJECT.md` with research roadmap

### 2026-02-16 — FCC Theory & Boids Experiment
- Developed the Falsifiable Causal Criterion (FCC): emergence occurs when macro-level dynamics become causally autonomous from micro-level substrate
- Chose boids flocking as test bed — simple agents, well-understood collective behavior
- Built experimental framework: `boids.py`, `boids_fast.py`, `sweep.py`, `analyze.py`, `metrics.py`
- Metric: Transfer Entropy Difference (TEΔ) across alignment strength α

### 2026-02-17 — Initial Results (Server Run)
- **Run configuration:** N=500 boids, 12 runs/α, `fcc_revised.py` method
- **Method:** Classification-based macro state (n_flocks, mode, coherence) with predictability analysis
- **Result:** `FCC_SUPPORTED` — critical α=0.04, predictability jump 0.13→0.78, Cohen's d=1.52
- Paper draft written (`FCC_PAPER.md`), passed simulated peer review, revised to State v4
- ARC website launched at arc.net.pk

### 2026-02-18 — Packaging for Local Reproduction
- Added results versioning to `run.py` (timestamped output folders)
- Created one-click launchers: `run.sh` (Linux/Mac), `run.bat` (Windows)
- Created `RUNNING.md` with simple instructions
- Goal: reproduce results on Faisal's local PC (GPU, 16 workers)

### 2026-02-19 — Local Reproduction Attempts

#### Run 1: Standard sweep, N=100 (local PC)
- **Config:** 100 boids, 10 runs/α, 31 α steps (0.0–3.0), 500 steps, 100 warmup
- **Result:** `FCC_FALSIFIED` — TEΔ flat at ~0.811, p=1.0, no phase transition
- **Interpretation:** N=100 too few agents for collective behavior to emerge
- **File:** `results/run_20260219_105504/`

#### Run 2: Standard sweep, N=500 (local PC)
- **Config:** 500 boids, 10 runs/α, 31 α steps (0.0–3.0), 16 workers
- **Result:** `FCC_FALSIFIED` — TEΔ flat at ~0.855, p=0.978, no phase transition
- **Key insight:** Standard TEΔ sweep does NOT detect the phase transition even at N=500
- **File:** `results/run_20260219_122549/`

#### Run 3: Revised FCC experiment, N=500 (local PC)
- **Config:** 500 boids, 20 runs/α, 31 α steps (0.00–0.30), 2000 steps, 500 warmup
- **Method:** Four-condition comparison:
  - A: Continuous polarization (baseline)
  - B: Binned polarization (discretization control)
  - C: (n_flocks, Mode) — key test
  - D: (n_flocks, Mode, Coherence) — full macro state
- **Result:** `DISCRETIZATION_ARTIFACT`
- **File:** `results/revised_20260219_165529/`

**Detailed findings:**

| Condition | Critical α | Cohen's d | 95% CI | p-value | Interpretation |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|---------|----------------|
| B (Binned Pol) | 0.15 | 0.56 | [0.41, 0.69] | 0.001 | Control shows jump → artifact concern |
| C (F, Mode) | 0.05 | -0.81 | [-1.05, -0.58] | 0.001 | Negative d = predictability *decreases* |
| D (F, Mode, Coh) | 0.15 | -0.38 | [-0.57, -0.21] | 0.001 | Weak, negative effect |

**Problems identified:**
1. The binned polarization control (Condition B) shows a significant jump (d=0.56), meaning the discretization process itself introduces apparent transitions
2. Conditions C and D show *negative* effect sizes — predictability decreases after the critical point, opposite to FCC prediction
3. DBSCAN robustness sweep shows critical α and effect size vary substantially with clustering parameters (eps, min_samples)
4. The confidence intervals on Cohen's d cross or approach zero for some DBSCAN configurations

## Discrepancy Analysis

### Original server result vs. local reproduction

| | Server (Feb 17) | Local Revised (Feb 19) |
|---|---|---|
| Verdict | FCC_SUPPORTED | DISCRETIZATION_ARTIFACT |
| Critical α | 0.04 | 0.05 (C) / 0.15 (B,D) |
| Cohen's d | 1.52 | -0.81 (C) / -0.38 (D) |
| Predictability | 0.13→0.78 | Decreases after transition |
| N boids | 500 | 500 |
| Runs/α | 12 | 20 |

**Possible explanations:**
1. The original `fcc_revised.py` run on the server may have used a different code version before subsequent edits
2. The server's 4-core CPU may have produced different parallel execution timing affecting RNG seeds
3. The original verdict file (`results/verdict.json`) was generated by a different analysis pipeline than the revised experiment
4. The "predictability" metric in the original may have been computed differently than the mutual information measure in the current code

**Conclusion:** The original result cannot be reliably reproduced. The revised experiment — which includes proper controls (binned polarization) — suggests the detected transition is a discretization artifact rather than genuine emergence.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always include a discretization control.** The binned polarization condition (B) was crucial — it revealed that the act of categorizing a continuous system into discrete macro states can itself create apparent phase transitions.

2. **Negative results are valuable.** The boids experiment demonstrates that simple spatial alignment does not produce the kind of causal autonomy FCC requires. This constrains the theory.

3. **Reproducibility matters.** The discrepancy between server and local runs highlights the importance of exact version control, fixed random seeds, and automated reproduction.

4. **Raw TEΔ is not sensitive enough.** The standard sweep (Runs 1 & 2) showed flat TEΔ regardless of N. Agent-level information transfer doesn't capture macro-level dynamics — which is actually consistent with the FCC theory's emphasis on *level separation*.

---

## What This Means for FCC Theory

The FCC theory is **not falsified by these results.** What's falsified is the hypothesis that boids flocking produces FCC-type emergence. The theory predicts:

> Emergence occurs when macro-level dynamics become causally autonomous — when knowing the macro state gives you more predictive power than knowing all micro states.

Boids alignment is a *continuous* parameter that smoothly increases polarization. There's no genuine level separation — the macro state (flock alignment) is a simple average of micro states (individual headings). True emergence would require the macro level to have dynamics that *cannot* be reduced to micro-level descriptions.

**Better experimental candidates:**
1. **Kuramoto oscillators** — known to have genuine phase transitions (synchronization), mathematically well-characterized critical coupling
2. **Language agent networks** — LLMs coupled through shared context may develop collective behaviors not reducible to individual agent outputs
3. **Neural cellular automata** — extending Faisal's original FYP work with modern tools
4. **Game-theoretic agents** — iterated games where collective strategies emerge that no individual agent "knows"

## Next Steps

1. ~~Reproduce boids results locally~~ ✅ (not reproduced — artifact)
2. [ ] Update FCC paper to acknowledge negative result and reframe
3. [ ] Implement Kuramoto oscillator experiment (clean phase transition, mathematical ground truth)
4. [ ] Design language agent coupling experiment
5. [ ] Update arc.net.pk with current status
6. [ ] Consider submitting negative result as a methods paper (demonstrating the discretization artifact problem)
